- DONE Redirect cerr to a string for handling soci error in server.cpp try-catch block. 

- Add client read of soci error string

- Adding server message back to tool with any soci error string. If error string == NULL, operation success must be sent to the tool.

- Add locking table and rollback to server DB interaction

- Tool should stay in the loop until a SUCCESS message is received from server

- DONE a tool directory is under development: it simulates the compilation of odaclient interface. Must be added to repository.

- STILL UNSOLVED !! DONE TEST. THAT PART OF THE CODE MISSES TWO messages. Only the last one is
stored. A test must be performed to see if a message m1(int, string, m2, m3) is
parsed correctly. I suspect that the m2 part is not examined. URGENT. The code
is in parser.cpp:156.

- Correct behaviour at point 8

- in server.cpp close(newsockfd) should be done before try-catch block.
  Otherwise an error on accept() is generated: the sock is still binded!
