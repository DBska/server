1 - DONE Server code needs a search of different message parts
2 - Redirect cerr to a string for handling soci error in server.cpp try-catch block. 
3 - Add client read of soci error string
4 - Adding server message back to tool with any soci error string. If error string == NULL, operation success must be sent to the tool.
5 - Add locking table and rollback to server DB interaction
6 - Tool should stay in the loop until a SUCCESS message is received from server
7 - a tool directory is under development: it simulates the compilation of odaclient interface. Must be added to repository.
8 - A test must be performed to see if a message m1(int, string, m2, m3) is
parsed correctly. I suspect that the m2 part is not examined. URGENT. The code
is in parser.cpp:156.
